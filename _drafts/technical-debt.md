You must have heard about technical debt. I had, but I didn't try to read about it (my bad). You know, the everyday sore: projects, job, freelancing... it all adds up and you backlog grows.

Well, that changed in May. And because of the everyday sore... yeah, didn't wrote about it either.

It started wi an e-mail from infoQ about a minibook called [Technical Debt and Software Craftsmanship][1]. It's a collection of six articles from infoQ and, having a Kindle at hand, I took some lunch time with this nice reading.

### Technical Debt - easy as that

It may sound silly, but knowing the exact term for something you think about makes all the difference in the world. I've always though about the concept of techninal debt, but didn't know how to convert them easily. What I did was a parallel with the concept of trade-off: where you chose uma option instead of another, knowing why and the consequences. Sometimes you may chose what's technically "bad", but you must go back at a later time and fix it.

I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's slow down.

### What is technical debt?



-> how does interest build up
-> the financial parallel
-> a model to deal with the debt (point the debt, add interest over time?)
